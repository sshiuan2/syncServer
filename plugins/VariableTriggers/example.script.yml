# This is a ScriptFile example.
# Naming scheme:
    # Save your script files as fileName.script.yml
    # do not use periods (.) comma's (,) spaces or any special characters in the
    # fileName part. All scriptfile's must end with .script.yml
    # The shorter the name the better.

# Create as many script file as you need, but don't create one for
# each script. You should spread them out at a 10 to 1 ratio.
# If you have 30 scripts you should put them in 3 files. if you have
# 100 scripts put them in 10 files. This is not an rule, just a suggestion.

# DO NOT MODIFY OR DELETE THIS FILE! Just create new ones.


# Here is how the scripts are saved. Notice that the two scripts below have the
# same name except for capitalization, but are seen as two different scripts.
# Do not use periods (.) comma's (,) spaces or any special characters in the
# name of a script.

Scripts:
  TestExample1:
    Script:
    - '@PLAYER This is a script line of a script named TestExample1'
    - '@CALL example:testexample1'
  testexample1:
    Script:
    - '@PLAYER Another script named testexample1'
    - '@PLAYER Notice that the names are case sensitive'
    - '@PLAYER A script can have as many lines as needed'
    
# You can have two scripts with the exact same name TestExample3 and TestExample3
# as long as they are in separate scriptfile's.

# DO NOT MODIFY OR DELETE THIS FILE! Just create new ones.
